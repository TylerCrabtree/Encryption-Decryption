Description:
This program will perform an encryption/decryption. The program will follow produce public and private keys. The program will also manipulate ctext and dtext files.I also attached a video showing how to run the code and will show the code working properly (just in case there are
issues running the code)

Run Directions
1. Open terminal
2. Use "cd" command to change directions to "CS427", then "cd" to "src" then cd to "project2".
3. Within the "project2" package/folder, run "ls" to ensure "Security.java" is there.
4. Use "javac Security.java" this will create a Security.class file. 
5. From here type "cd .." you should be in the "src" folder, type "ls" and "project2" should be listed.
4. Type the command "java project2.Security",the program should be running. 
5. The program will prompt you with commands, follow any commands then type "exit". 
6. The program should have finished.
7. If you have any questions how to run the code, the video shows all the terminal commands to run the code. Thank you.

Notes:
I found that eclipse and terminal will grab their supplemental files from different locations (that is why there is copies in different folders), for terminal usage, modify the files within the src folder.
Feel free to contact me at my email if you have any questions.
